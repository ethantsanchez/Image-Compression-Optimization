# Image-Compression-Optimization (USC, 2024)
Built a MATLAB algorithm with linear algebra and optimization techniques to compress images, cutting storage by 97% and saving 1,248,000 bytes from an original total 1,280,000 bytes (only using up 32,000 bytes - just 2.5% of the original data) - in the top-10-eigenvectors solution.
Showcases optimization and engineering design.
